                <p>Teamo is the best solution to building your team, from fantasy pro leagues in the BPL, World Cup, and MLS,
                    to your local teams. Whether youâ€™re the coach, manager, or an avid fan looking to win your fantasy league,
                    Teamo will provide the most efficient solution in recommending players, formations, and team management.</p>

                <p>Currently, there is no other app that will provide the same service we use, outside of a gaming context.
                    The most popular example of what we are going to accomplish is the FIFA Team Builder, built by EA sports.
                    However, this only allows people to build teams for the game based off of professional players. Teamo will
                    have a manual input option, so not only can you import data (coming soon), you can build your team with your players.</p>

                <p>Teamo will benefit society by creating incredible new soccer teams, giving players more opportunities to stand
                    out, by giving them their best position. This will increase the overall competition in the sport, as well as
                    increase competition in fantasy leagues.</p>

                <p>This app is directed towards soccer team managers and coaches, because it provides an easy to read interface,
                    which will building teams much easier to coaches and managers. Instead of having to spend time seeing where
                    players will fit, Teamo will find the perfect position for every player, the perfect formation for the team,
                    and find the perfect substitutes!</p>
